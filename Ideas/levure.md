### Levure

#### Logger Log Monitor
[Issue 147](https://github.com/trevordevore/levure/issues/147)
-   Select font/size (so can go mono/regular)
-   Set/remember window size
-   Checkbox for reverse order
-   Checkbox for "Now"/keep scroll current (regular scroll, keep the bottom line in view)
-   Wrap/don't

#### Logger
[Issue 146](https://github.com/trevordevore/levure/issues/146)

Different Targets For Different Log Types.  Example: developer messages go to one file, errors to another file. Then you can have multiple log windows open tracking the different message types.


#### Baker's Assistant
[Issue 3] (https://github.com/macMikey/lc-hacktoberfest/edit/master/Ideas/levure.md)

The Bakers Assistant plug-in should allow a developer to search for helpers in a central location. The helpers should be able to be installed automatically into the application. If the application uses git then the option of adding the helper as a submodule should be available.
