# livecode-hacktoberfest
## About
This repo exists to help the livecode community plan for the upcoming Hacktoberfest.   Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software.  Each October, open source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests on GitHub.  As a reward for your contribution, sponsors of the event give swag, such as t-shirts and stickers to anyone who submits four pull requests during the event.
Hacktoberfest runs from October 1, to 31, and is open to anyone who registers **(link needed)**.
Your pull requests do not have to be accepted.  You just have to make them.

## HELP!  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GIT
 For help learning how to use git, github, any of the graphical git tools, text editors, or go diving into the weeds in liveCode, just ask for help on the LC forums, or on one of the LC mailing lists (or click on the [*Issues*](https://github.com/macMikey/lc-hacktoberfest/issues) tab, above).

## How to Git In On The Planning
1. Fork or clone this repo. 
2. Update the suggestion files with ideas, suggestions, things you want to work on, etc.  They don't have to be big things.  Even fixing a typo in the documentation for a particular entry counts.
3. Commit the changes to the suggestion files and issue a pull request to this repo

## What is .md?
You will notice that many of the files are .md files.  .md stands for "markdown", and is just a way of using text characters to mark formatting for the file.
#### If you want to learn the syntax of markdown, try
