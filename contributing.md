Welcome to the 100% unofficial LiveCode Hacktoberfest repo.
This is an attempt to get new LC community members into the habit of poking around, working on, and hacking various LC projects that we can make better.

## Submitting ideas
Inside the _Ideas_ folder in this repo are ideas for the various projects.  Fork or clone this repo, update those files or add new ones, and then issue a pull request back to the repo.

## Notifying the repo that I've completed one of the items in the _Ideas_ folder
I think the best way to do that is probably to use the ~~strikethrough~~ (double tilde) on both sides of the item.  At the end, add a blank line, the PR number for that project, and your github username.

## I have a problem with the lc-hacktoberfest project itself
Click on the _Issues_ tab, above, and submit your issue.
